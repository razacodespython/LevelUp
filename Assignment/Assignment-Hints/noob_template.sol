// MultiSigWallet contract for managing multi-signature transactions

    // Event emitted when a deposit is made to the contract

    // Events are used to notify external parties about state changes
    
    // Event emitted when a transaction is submitted to the contract

    // Event emitted when a transaction is confirmed by an owner
    
    // Event emitted when a confirmation for a transaction is revoked 

    // Event emitted when a transaction is executed
    

    // Array to store the addresses of the owners of the contract
    // Arrays are used to store collections of data
    
    // Mapping to check if an address is an owner
    // Mappings are used for key-value storage
    
    // Number of confirmations required for a transaction to be executed
    // State variables hold data permanently
    

    // Struct to represent a transaction
    // Structs are used to define custom data types
    

    // Mapping to track which owners have confirmed a transaction
    // Nested mappings are used for efficient data retrieval
    

    // Array to store all transactions
    // Arrays of structs are used for storing multiple instances of structured data
    

    // Modifier to restrict access to only owners
    // Modifiers are used to add conditions to function executions
    

    // Modifier to check if a transaction exists
    // Modifiers help in code reuse and readability
    

    // Modifier to check if a transaction has not been executed
    // Modifiers can help in enforcing certain conditions before executing functions
    

    // Modifier to check if an owner has not already confirmed a transaction
    // Modifiers are used for access control and validation
    

    // Constructor to initialize the contract with owners and required confirmations
    // Constructors are special functions called only once during contract deployment
    
        // Constructor parameters initialize contract state
        // Require statements validate inputs before deploying the contract
        

        // Initialize owners array and mapping
        // Loop through the provided owners to add them to the contract
        

        // Set number of required confirmations
        // Initialize contract state with constructor parameters
        

    // Fallback function to receive Ether
    // Fallback functions are executed when a contract receives Ether without data
    

    // Function to submit a transaction to the contract
    // Public functions are accessible externally
    
        // Create new transaction and add to array
        // Add a new transaction to the transactions array
        
        // Emit event for submitted transaction
        // Emit an event to notify external parties about the submitted transaction
        
    

    // Function to confirm a transaction by an owner
    // Confirmations are required from multiple owners to execute a transaction
    
    
        // Update transaction confirmation status
        // Update transaction details and mark the transaction as confirmed by the caller


        // Emit event for transaction confirmation
        // Notify external parties about the confirmation


    // Function to execute a transaction
    // Transactions are executed once the required confirmations are met

        // Ensure required confirmations are met
        // Check if the required number of confirmations is met to execute the transaction

        // Mark transaction as executed
        // Set the executed flag to true to prevent re-execution

        // Execute the transaction
        // Call the external contract or transfer Ether

        // Emit event for executed transaction
        // Notify external parties about the executed transaction


    // Function to revoke confirmation of a transaction by an owner
    // Owners can revoke their confirmations before a transaction is executed

        // Update transaction confirmation status
        // Revoke confirmation of the transaction by the caller
        

        // Emit event for revoked confirmation
        // Notify external parties about the revoked confirmation
        

    // Function to get the list of owners
    // Public view function to retrieve the list of contract owners
    

    // Function to get the count of transactions
    // Public view function to retrieve the total number of transactions
    

    // Function to get details of a transaction
    // Public view function to retrieve details of a specific transaction
    
        // Get transaction details
